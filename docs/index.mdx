# Intro

`MavenDeployer` is a lightweight, handy Gradle plugin to deploy your maven packages (for example, Android AARs, Java JARs, Kotlin KLibs)
to different kinds of repositories. It supports publishing to:
- local directories, to use them as local maven repositories in other projects
- [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.org/) repository via Sonatype's OSSRH
- Other Sonatype Nexus repositories
- [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages)

> For Maven Central builds, the plugin takes care of releasing the artifacts using Sonatype REST APIs so you don't have to use their web UI.
