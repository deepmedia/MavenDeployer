# Intro

`MavenDeployer` is a lightweight, handy Gradle plugin to deploy your maven packages (for example, Android AARs, Java JARs, Kotlin KLibs)
to different kinds of repositories. It supports publishing to:
- local directories, to use them as local maven repositories in other projects
- [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/) repository via Sonatype's OSSRH
- [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/) repository via Sonatype's [Central Portal](https://central.sonatype.org/register/central-portal/)
- Other Sonatype Nexus repositories
- [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages)

> For Maven Central builds, the plugin takes care of releasing the artifacts using Sonatype REST APIs so you don't have to use their web UI.

It supports automatic configuration for a certain set of projects:

- [Android Projects](artifacts#android-projects)
- [Kotlin Projects](artifacts#kotlin-regular-projects)
- [Kotlin Multiplatform Projects](artifacts#kotlin-multiplatform-projects)
- [Gradle Plugin Projects](artifacts#gradle-plugin-projects)

In addition, you may configure deployments manually based on some existing `SoftwareComponent`, `MavenPublication` or simple file artifacts.
