# Usage and tasks

## Usage

Plugin configuration happens through the `deployer` extension. You act on it by adding one or more `DeploySpec`s
and configuring them. Every spec can be configured independently and offers many options:

```kotlin
interface DeploySpec {
    val content: Content
    val auth: Auth
    val projectInfo: ProjectInfo
    val release: Release
    val signing: Signing
}
```

For example, to create a spec that deploys to GitHub and configure the version number, you may do:

```kotlin
deployer {
    githubSpec {
        release.version = "1.0.0"
        ...
    }
}
```

Please check out the [artifacts](artifacts) and [configuration](configuration) docs to learn how to configure specs properly.

## Default spec

In most cases, instead of configuring each spec separately, you will configure what we call the **default spec**.
The default spec is the deployer extension itself, and acts as a root configuration provider.

Its values will be propagated to all child specs and used as fallbacks in case the child is not configured.
For example:

```kotlin
deployer {
    release.version = "1.0.0" // our default
    ...

    nexusSpec {
        // release.version is 1.0.0
        ...
    }

    nexusSpec("snapshot") {
        // snapshot publishing. Override the default version
        release.version = "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
        ...
    }
}
```

## Tasks

For each spec, the plugin will register a gradle task named `deploy<SpecType><SpecName>`. The spec type is either local,
github, nexus or centralPortal. The name defaults to `""` but can be configured. In addition, an extra task called `deployAll` will be
generated, running all deployments at once. In the example above, the following tasks are generated:

- `deployNexus`
- `deployNexusSnapshot`
- `deployAll`

> **Note**: Use ./gradlew tasks --group='Deployment' to list all deploy tasks.

The plugin will also register the `printProjectComponents` task for debugging.
