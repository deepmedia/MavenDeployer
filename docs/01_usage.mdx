# Usage and tasks

## Usage

Plugin configuration happens through the `deployer` extension. You act on it by adding one or more `DeploySpec`s
and configuring them. In addition, the `defaultSpec` can be used to configure default values that will be propagated
to all other specs.

```kotlin
deployer {
    defaultSpec {
        release.version.set("1.0.0")
    }

    sonatypeSpec {
        // release.version is 1.0.0
        ...
    }

    sonatypeSpec("snapshot") {
        release.version.set("1.0.0-SNAPSHOT") // override default value
        ...
    }
}
```

## Tasks

For each spec, the plugin will register a gradle task named `deploy<SpecType><SpecName>`. The spec type is either local,
github, or sonatype. The name defaults to `""` but can be configured. In addition, an extra task called `deployAll` will be
generated, running all deployments at once. In the example above, the following tasks are generated:

- `deploySonatype`
- `deploySonatypeSnapshot`
- `deployAll`

> **Note**: Use ./gradlew tasks --group='Deployment' to list all deploy tasks.
