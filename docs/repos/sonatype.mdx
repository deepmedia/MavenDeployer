# Sonatype & Maven Central

Add a new spec with `sonatypeSpec {}` or `nexusSpec {}`. It adds a mandatory property called `repositoryUrl`, which is the remote URL
of the sonatype repo. This defaults to `https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2/`, one of the
OSSRH urls that can be synced to Maven Central.

```kotlin
deployer {
    // Common configuration...
    project.description.set("Handy tool to publish maven packages in different repositories.")

    sonatypeSpec {
        // Target URL. You can use `ossrh`, `ossrh1`, `ossrhSnapshots`, `ossrhSnapshots1` or your own URL
        repositoryUrl.set(ossrh1)

        // For OSSRH projects, these are the credentials that were used to register the package group into OSSRH
        auth.user.set(secret("SONATYPE_USER"))
        auth.password.set(secret("SONATYPE_PASSWORD"))

        // Note: signing is required for Maven Central sync
        signing.key.set(secret("SIGNING_KEY"))
        signing.password.set(secret("SIGNING_PASSWORD"))
    }

    // If needed, you can add other named specs.
    sonatypeSpec("snapshot") {
        repositoryUrl.set(ossrhSnapshots1)
        release.version.set("latest-SNAPSHOT")
        ...
    }
}
```

## Maven Central sync

Sonatype's OSSRH projects are allowed to sync artifacts with the [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.org/) repository.
The process is generally tricky, because you have to:

- Build maven packages with a very strict set of rules (for example, signing is mandatory)
- Deploy them to `oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2` or `s01.oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2`
- Access the web interface at `oss.sonatype.org` or `s01.oss.sonatype.org`
- Login with your credentials
- Find the staging repository corresponding to the upload, `Close` it and then `Release` it

Deployer streamlines the process so that only the first step is really your responsibility.
First, enable maven central sync using `syncToMavenCentral`:

```kotlin
sonatypeSpec {
    syncToMavenCentral = true

    auth.user = secret("SONATYPE_USER")
    auth.password = secret("SONATYPE_PASSWORD")
}
```

Then simply run the deploy task. Deployer will:

- Validate your artifacts and POM file, to ensure they won't be rejected by the backend
- Fail with clear errors if any issue is found
- Use Sonatype's REST APIs to create a staging repository in your Sonatype account
- Upload the artifacts
- Use Sonatype's REST APIs to close and release the staging repository
