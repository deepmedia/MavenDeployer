# Repositories

Different types of repositories offer differ APIs to configure them, which is often mandatory. These options are
exposed through subclasses of the `DeploySpec` type, so that, for example, a `localSpec { }` block will expose
`LocalDeploySpec` properties.

`MavenDeployer` supports publishing to:
- [local directories](local), to use them as local maven repositories in other projects
- Sonatype's [Nexus](sonatype) repositories, with support for syncing OSSRH projects to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.org/)
- Sonatype's [Central Portal](central-portal) uploads, a modern entry point for Maven Central
- [GitHub Packages](github)
