# Local directory

Add a new spec with `localSpec {}`. The only configurable property is the directory into which to publish the artifacts:

```kotlin
deployer {
    localSpec {
        directory.set(file("my/dir/here"))
    }

    // If needed, you can add other named specs.
    localSpec("other") { ... }
}
```

If the directory is not set, this defaults to the `mavenLocal()` repository.
