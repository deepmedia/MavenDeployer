# Repositories

Different types of repositories offer differ APIs to configure them, which is often mandatory. These options are
exposed through subclasses of the `DeploySpec` type, so that, for example, a `localSpec { }` block will expose
`LocalDeploySpec` properties.

`MavenDeployer` supports publishing to:
- local directories, to use them as local maven repositories in other projects [[docs](00_local)]
- Sonatype Nexus repositories, including [Sonatype OSSRH / Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.org/) [[docs](01_sonatype)]
- [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages) [[docs](02_github)]
