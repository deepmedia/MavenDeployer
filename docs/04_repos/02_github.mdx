# Github Packages

Add a new spec with `githubSpec {}`. It adds two mandatory properties, `owner` and `repository`, which
are used to identify the GitHub repository.

In addition to this, it is also mandatory to authenticate to GitHub using your username and a
[personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#about-scopes-and-permissions-for-package-registries).
These can be added as secrets to the `auth` block, as shown below.

```kotlin
deployer {
    // Common configuration...
    project.description.set("Handy tool to publish maven packages in different repositories.")

    githubSpec {
        // Identify the GitHub repository: deepmedia/MavenDeployer
        owner.set("deepmedia")
        repository.set("MavenDeployer")

        // Personal GitHub username and a personal access token linked to it
        auth.user.set(secret("GITHUB_USER"))
        auth.token.set(secret("GITHUB_TOKEN"))
    }

    // If needed, you can add other named specs.
    githubSpec("private") {
        ...
    }
}
```
