# Install

## Build configuration

To use `MavenDeployer` in your project, add the following lines:

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

// build.gradle.kts of deployable modules
plugins {
    id("io.deepmedia.tools.deployer") version "0.10.0"
}
```

## Snapshots

The plugin uses an older version of itself to publish itself to the Maven Central repository
and to GitHub Packages. This means that you can check the plugin source code to see an example of how to use it.

It also uses itself to publish snapshots to `https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/`
on each push to main. To use the snapshots, add the url as a maven repository and depend on
`id("io.deepmedia.tools.deployer") version "latest-SNAPSHOT"`.
