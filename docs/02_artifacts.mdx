# Spec artifacts

The contents of a deploy spec (e.g. AARs, JARs, additional artifacts like sources or javadocs) can be configured at `spec.content`.
Each spec can support multiple components, each one corresponding to a maven publication and pom file.

## Component inference

By default, the plugin will try to infer the spec components based on the project structure and plugins. We currently
support the following use cases:

1. Kotlin Multiplatform projects: enabled when the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin is applied.
   The deploy spec will have one component per target, plus one component publishing the 'common' metadata.
2. Android libraries: enabled when `com.android.library` plugin is applied.
   The deploy spec will have a single component based on the release AAR.
3. Gradle Plugins: enabled when `java-gradle-plugin` plugin is applied and `gradlePlugin.isAutomatedPublishing` is true.
   The deploy spec will have one component for the project, and one gradle marker component for each plugin in `gradlePlugin.plugins`.
4. Java projects: enabled when the java base plugin is applied.
   The deploy spec will have a single component from the `java` software component.

## Custom components

To declare custom components, simply add them to `spec.content`. Two types of custom components are supported:

- Based on an existing Gradle [SoftwareComponent](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/component/SoftwareComponent.html)
- Based on an existing Gradle [MavenPublication](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.publish.maven.MavenPublication.html)

```kotlin
deployer {
    defaultSpec.content {
        softwareComponent("mySoftwareComponent") { ... }

        // cloning the publication makes sure that it can be shared across multiple specs.
        mavenPublication("myMavenPublication", clone = false) { ... }

        // other options: under the hood, they call softwareComponent or mavenPublication
        kotlinTarget(myKotlinTarget, clone = false) { ... }
        gradlePluginDeclaration(myPluginDeclaration, clone = false) { ... }
    }
}
```

## Component extras

The component builders mentioned above describe the main published artifact (for example, a jar with binary code).
It is possible however to add more files to the publication:

- sources: use `component.sources(mySourcesTask)`
- javadocs: use `component.docs(myJavadocTask)`
- other artifacts: use `component.extras.add(...)`

You can also leverage automatic sources and/or docs depending on your project. Use:

- `content.emptySources()` or `content.emptyDocs()` to create an empty JAR. Might be useful for some repositories that require these jars to be present.
- `content.autoSources()` to add a sources JAR, configured based on your project
- `content.autoDocs()` to add a documentation JAR, for Kotlin projects only (uses Dokka under the hood)
